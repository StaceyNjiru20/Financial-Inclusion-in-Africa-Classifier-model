# Financial-Inclusion-in-Africa-Classifier-model
The **Financial Inclusion in Africa Classifier** predicts whether an individual has access to formal financial services (e.g., a bank account) based on socio-economic and demographic factors like income, education, and location. It helps identify underbanked populations, supporting efforts to improve financial inclusion across Africa.
